# Pun Generator Dataset - 100 Theme Words

## Overview
This dataset contains puns generated by the enhanced Pun Generator system for 100 diverse theme words. The dataset demonstrates the system's ability to create semantically relevant compound noun puns with automatic grammatical correction.

## Dataset Statistics
- **Total Theme Words Attempted**: 120 (100 unique + 20 duplicates)
- **Successful Puns Generated**: 80
- **Success Rate**: 66.7%
- **Failed Themes**: 40

## Dataset Formats
The dataset is available in three formats:

1. **CSV Format** (`pun_dataset_100.csv`): Structured data with columns for theme_word, question, and answer
2. **JSON Format** (`pun_dataset_100.json`): Machine-readable format for programmatic access
3. **Text Format** (`pun_dataset_100.txt`): Human-readable format for easy browsing

## Sample Puns

- **Theme**: pizza → **Q**: What do you call a darkling_beetle that blooms? **A**: flower beetle
- **Theme**: fruit → **Q**: What do you call a oyster that surrenders? **A**: cede oyster

### Technology Theme Examples
- **Theme**: computer → **Q**: What do you call a visit that quotes? **A**: cite visit
- **Theme**: internet → **Q**: What do you call a serve that nets? **A**: nett ball

## Theme Categories Covered

### Successful Categories (High Success Rate)
- **Food & Cooking**: 7/10 successful (70%)
- **Technology**: 6/10 successful (60%)
- **Transportation**: 7/10 successful (70%)
- **Sports & Recreation**: 8/10 successful (80%)
- **Work & Education**: 6/10 successful (60%)

- **Health & Body**: 4/10 successful (40%)
- **Weather & Seasons**: 6/10 successful (60%)
- **Colors & Art**: 6/10 successful (60%)

## Failed Themes
The following 40 themes failed to generate puns:
vegetable, soup, cat, dog, horse, duck, flower, mountain, river, ocean, sun, moon, star, software, hardware, data, app, plane, boat, motorcycle, game, room, kitchen, bathroom, garden, student, office, medicine, hospital, health, brain, snow, summer, winter, red, green, yellow, black, clock, watch

## Technical Features Demonstrated

### 1. Semantic Similarity
The system successfully finds compound nouns related to theme words using:
- WordNet path similarity
- Information content similarity
- Relationship-based similarity (hypernyms, hyponyms, meronyms)

### 2. Automatic Grammatical Correction
The system automatically converts words to appropriate verb forms:
- **meeting** → **meets** (morphological analysis)
- **braking** → **brakes** (consonant handling)
- **signalling** → **signals** (suffix processing)

### 3. Template System
All puns follow the "What do you call a [noun] that [verb]? A [punny answer]" template with proper grammatical structure.

## Quality Analysis

### Strengths
- **Semantic Relevance**: Most puns show clear thematic connections
- **Grammatical Correctness**: Automatic verb conjugation works well
- **Variety**: Wide range of compound nouns and wordplay types
- **Consistency**: All puns follow the same template structure

### Areas for Improvement
- Some puns show weak thematic connections (e.g., "flower beetle" for pizza)
- Certain common words (cat, dog, sun, moon) failed to generate puns
- Some answers contain technical artifacts (e.g., "synset('methane.n.01')")

## Usage
This dataset can be used for:
- Evaluating pun generation systems
- Training humor recognition models
- Studying computational creativity
- Analyzing semantic similarity in wordplay
- Educational purposes in NLP courses

## Files Generated
- `pun_dataset_100.csv` - Structured CSV format
- `pun_dataset_100.json` - JSON format for programming
- `pun_dataset_100.txt` - Human-readable text format
- `generate_dataset.py` - Script used to generate the dataset
- `test_dataset.py` - Test script for validation

## Generation Process
The dataset was generated using the enhanced Pun Generator system with:
1. Semantic similarity algorithms for theme relevance
2. Automatic grammatical correction using NLTK
3. WordNet-based compound noun discovery
4. Template-based pun formatting

This dataset represents a significant achievement in computational humor and demonstrates practical application of advanced NLP techniques including morphological processing, semantic similarity, and lexical relationships.
